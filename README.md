## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using a Workflow in Your Repository

1. **Create a workflow file** in your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
2. **Reference the reusable workflow** from this repository:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-checks:
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/python-quality.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: "3.12"
      coverage-threshold: 80
```

3. **Customize parameters** as needed for your project
4. **Commit and push** - your workflow will run automatically!

## Public repository inventory

The [public repository inventory](portfolio/README.md) records repository purpose, direct Renovate policy,
workflow declarations and required checks with dated evidence and explicit unknowns.
Its [canonical data](portfolio/repositories.yaml) is shared portfolio context; proposals are kept separate
from observed configuration.
