## 🎨 Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Workflow
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/python-quality.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: "3.11"
      coverage-threshold: 80
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Stage Pipeline
```yaml
name: Complete CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/python-quality.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: "3.11"

  security:
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/security-scan.yml@main
    needs: quality

  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
    needs: [quality, security]
```

### Pattern 3: Matrix Strategy
```yaml
name: Multi-Version Testing
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/python-quality.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```
