## üìè Workflow Standards

### File Organization

```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/          # Main reusable workflows
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python-quality.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ansible-lint.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-build.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-workflows/      # Reference implementations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-python-quality.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ use-ansible-lint.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow-templates/ # Organization templates
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python-ci.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ansible-ci.yml
```

### Naming Conventions

#### Workflow Files
- Use **kebab-case** for file names: `python-quality.yml`, `docker-build-push.yml`
- Be **descriptive and specific**: `terraform-validate.yml` not `tf.yml`
- Include **primary action** in the name: `build`, `test`, `deploy`, `validate`

#### Input Parameters
- Use **snake_case** for input names: `python_version`, `enable_security_scan`
- Provide **clear descriptions** and default values
- Group **related parameters** logically

#### Job and Step Names
- Use **descriptive, action-oriented** names
- Be **consistent** across similar workflows
- Include **context** when helpful: "Install Python dependencies", "Run security scan"

### Input/Output Standards

#### Required Inputs
```yaml
inputs:
  # Always required - no sensible default
  python-version:
    description: 'Python version to use for testing'
    required: true
    type: string
```

#### Optional Inputs with Defaults
```yaml
inputs:
  # Optional with sensible defaults
  coverage-threshold:
    description: 'Minimum coverage percentage required'
    required: false
    default: '80'
    type: string
  
  enable-security-scan:
    description: 'Enable security vulnerability scanning'
    required: false
    default: 'true'
    type: boolean
```

#### Outputs
```yaml
outputs:
  # Always provide useful outputs
  coverage-percentage:
    description: 'Actual coverage percentage achieved'
    value: ${{ jobs.test.outputs.coverage }}
  
  security-issues:
    description: 'Number of security issues found'
    value: ${{ jobs.security.outputs.issues }}
```

### Error Handling

#### Fail Fast Principles
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Validate inputs
    run: |
      if [[ -z "${{ inputs.python-version }}" ]]; then
        echo "Error: python-version is required"
        exit 1
      fi
```

#### Meaningful Error Messages
```yaml
  - name: Check coverage threshold
    run: |
      if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "‚ùå Coverage $COVERAGE% is below threshold $THRESHOLD%"
        echo "Please add more tests to reach the required coverage"
        exit 1
      fi
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Pre-Submission Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Test with real projects** of varying complexity
2. **Validate all input combinations** including edge cases
3. **Test error conditions** and failure scenarios
4. **Verify outputs** are correct and useful
5. **Check performance** with realistic workloads

### Testing Framework

#### Create Test Repository
```bash
# Create a test repository structure
mkdir test-project
cd test-project

# Initialize with the technology stack you're testing
# For Python:
mkdir src tests
echo "def hello(): return 'world'" > src/main.py
echo "from src.main import hello; def test_hello(): assert hello() == 'world'" > tests/test_main.py

# Add workflow file
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cat > .github/workflows/test.yml << EOF
name: Test Workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/python-quality.yml@YOUR-BRANCH
    with:
      python-version: "3.11"
EOF
```

#### Validate Workflow Syntax
```bash
# Use GitHub CLI to validate syntax
gh workflow view .github/workflows/test.yml

# Or use act for local testing
act -n  # Dry run to validate syntax
```

### Test Matrix

Test your workflow with:

#### Different Input Combinations
- **Minimum required inputs** only
- **All optional inputs** specified
- **Edge case values** (empty strings, extreme numbers)
- **Invalid inputs** (verify proper error handling)

#### Various Project Types
- **Simple projects** - basic setup
- **Complex projects** - multiple dependencies, configurations
- **Edge cases** - empty projects, unusual structures
- **Real-world projects** - existing open source projects

#### Different Environments
- **Ubuntu** (latest and older versions)
- **Windows** (if applicable)
- **macOS** (if applicable)
- **Different runner sizes** (resource constraints)

### Performance Testing

#### Measure Key Metrics
- **Execution time** for different project sizes
- **Resource usage** (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Cache effectiveness** (hit rates, build time reduction)
- **Cost implications** (GitHub Actions minutes)

#### Optimize for Performance
```yaml
# Use caching effectively
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: pip-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt') }}

# Minimize unnecessary work
- name: Check if tests are needed
  id: changes
  run: |
    if git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | grep -E '\.(py|txt)$'; then
      echo "needs-testing=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
```

## üìö Documentation Requirements

### Inline Documentation

#### Workflow Comments
```yaml
name: Python Quality Checks
# This workflow provides comprehensive Python quality assurance including:
# - Code formatting (Black, isort)
# - Linting (Flake8, pylint)
# - Type checking (MyPy)
# - Security scanning (Bandit, Safety)
# - Testing and coverage (pytest, coverage.py)

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      python-version:
        description: |
          Python version to use for testing.
          Supports: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, latest
        required: true
        type: string
```

#### Step Documentation
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install Python dependencies
    # Install project dependencies with pip caching for performance.
    # Uses requirements.txt by default, but can be overridden with inputs.
    run: |
      pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install -r ${{ inputs.requirements-file }}
```

### External Documentation

#### Workflow Documentation File
Each workflow must have a corresponding documentation file in `docs/workflows/`:

```markdown
# docs/workflows/python-quality.md

### Example Documentation

#### Comprehensive Usage Example
```yaml
# Include a complete, working example
name: Python CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/python-quality.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: "3.11"
      coverage-threshold: 85
      enable-security-scan: true
      requirements-file: "requirements-dev.txt"
    secrets:
      CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

#### Configuration File Examples
```yaml
# Show complete configuration file examples
# pyproject.toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py39', 'py310', 'py311']

[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["src"]
omit = ["tests/*"]
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Secure Workflow Design

#### Input Validation
```yaml
# Validate all inputs
- name: Validate Python version
  run: |
    case "${{ inputs.python-version }}" in
      3.9|3.10|3.11|3.12|latest) ;;
      *) echo "Invalid Python version"; exit 1 ;;
    esac
```

#### Secret Handling
```yaml
# Never log secrets
- name: Authenticate with registry
  run: echo "${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
  # Note: This is safe because GitHub automatically masks secrets in logs
```

#### Least Privilege
```yaml
# Use minimal permissions
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write  # Only if needed for security scanning
```

### Security Review Checklist

Before submitting:

- [ ] **No hardcoded secrets** or credentials
- [ ] **Input validation** for all user-provided data
- [ ] **Secure defaults** for all configuration options

```

#### Verify Third-Party Actions
```yaml
# Research and verify any third-party actions
- uses: well-known-org/trusted-action@v1.2.3
  # Verify: reputation, maintenance, security track record
```
