## Usage Examples

### Python Project Integration

```yaml
name: Python Quality Checks
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  quality:
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/python-quality.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: "3.12"
      coverage-threshold: 80
```

### Ansible Project Integration

```yaml
name: Ansible Lint
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    uses: basher83/.github/.github/workflows/ansible-lint.yml@main
